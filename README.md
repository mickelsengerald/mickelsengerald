# Hello, I'm Gerald Mickelsen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a proactive and efficient Civil Industrial Engineer and Web Developer, dedicated to delivering innovative solutions.

## ðŸ“˜ About me

I possess the skills to work in a team and to lead in a cooperative and respectful manner, aligning myself with the objectives and expectations that are required. In addition, I can perform in high-pressure work environments, reflecting that I can act with persistence, planning, organization, responsibility, punctuality, commitment, flexibility, and proper tolerance to frustration, which facilitates me to prioritize and analyze complex tasks with confidence and achieve successful results, provided with reliability and quality.

In the development of projects and my general work, I impress with achievement motivation, enthusiasm, adequate predisposition, good control of my impulses, and always open to listen to the suggestions and criticisms of others. However, I have also been seen as very demanding, both with myself and with others, because I unintentionally expect that, as a group, we perform at a good pace of work and finish the proposed activities in the established time.

Regarding my ideas and perspectives, I always seek challenging tasks, in which I can create, innovate, or apply work tools that favor and optimize institutional goals and, in the personal area, I hope to acquire experiences that allow me to nourish myself with new knowledge and technologies to keep up to date with current and future trends in the field of civil engineering and web development.

Lastly, I wish to express that I am willing to connect with other professionals, face and discuss opportunities, or simply learn from others in my field. Feel free to contact me.
